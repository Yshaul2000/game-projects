# Game Projects Collection

Welcome to the **Game Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of small Python-based games that I have developed as part of my learning journey in programming and game development.

## Projects Included:

- **Quiz Game**: A trivia quiz game that tests your knowledge with various questions.
- **Snake Game**: The classic Snake game where you control a snake and try to eat the food while avoiding obstacles.
- **Pong Game**: A simple version of the classic Pong game, where two players compete against each other to score points.

## Features:

- Simple, user-friendly gameplay
- Python-based (great for learning and experimenting with Python)
- Basic game mechanics, including user inputs and graphical output
